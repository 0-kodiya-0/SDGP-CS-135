## Status Updates

### How to Update Status

1. Create a branch from 'user-interface' branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b ui/status-update-[date]
   ```

2. Update the status in the tables using these symbols:
   - 🔄 Pending: Not started
   - ⏳ In Progress: Currently being worked on
   - ✅ Completed: Ready for review
   - 🔍 In Review: Under peer review
   - ❌ Blocked: Facing impediments

3. Commit your changes using this format:

   ```bash
   Update UI work status [date]

   Update component development status:
   - [Component Name]: [Old Status] -> [New Status]
   - [Component Name]: [Old Status] -> [New Status]

   Additional Notes:
   - [Any blockers or important information]
   - [Any dependencies or requirements]

   Task: FUSION-[number]
   ```

4. Example commit message:

   ```bash
   Update UI work status 2024-12-17

   Update component development status:
   - Navbar: 🔄 -> ⏳
   - Sign In Form: ⏳ -> ✅
   - Video Call Room: 🔄 -> ❌

   Additional Notes:
   - Video Call Room blocked pending WebRTC integration
   - Sign In Form ready for review
   ```

### Status Update Frequency

- Update status at least twice per week
- Update immediately when component status changes
- Include details about blockers or dependencies

### Status Review Process

1. Component Lead (Kehan or Sanithu) reviews status updates
2. Updates discussed in daily standups
3. Blockers escalated to Scrum Master (Channa)

### Status Key

- 🔄 Pending: Not started
- ⏳ In Progress: Currently being worked on
- ✅ Completed: Ready for review
- 🔍 In Review: Under peer review
- ❌ Blocked: Facing impediments
