## Overview

FusionSpace employs a three-panel layout structure that prioritizes workflow efficiency and intuitive navigation. This layout strategy is designed to maximize workspace utility while maintaining easy access to tools and features.

## Main Layout Structure

### Base Layout

```
+------------------+----------------------+
|     Top Nav      |         Nav         |
+------------------+----------------------+
|                  |                     |
|   Left Sidebar   |    Main Content     |
|                  |                     |
|                  |                     |
|                  |                     |
+------------------+----------------------+
|           Bottom Navbar                |
+---------------------------------------+
```

The three-panel structure is crucial because:

- Separates navigation from content
- Provides clear visual hierarchy
- Allows for efficient space utilization
- Supports both focused and overview work modes

## Panel Organization

### Top Navigation

**Layout Approach**: Flex container

- Provides natural spacing between elements
- Allows for responsive resizing
- Supports easy alignment of groups of items

**Key Elements**:

- Environment Selector (left)
- Search Bar (center)
- Utility Icons (right)

This arrangement ensures:

- Quick access to core functions
- Clear visual separation of tools
- Intuitive placement of related items

### Left Sidebar

**Layout Approach**: Flex column with nested lists

- Supports hierarchical information display
- Allows for easy expansion/collapse
- Maintains clear relationship between items

**Why This Works**:

- Natural organization of related items
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Easy navigation between different sections

### Main Content Area

**Layout Approach**: Grid system for content organization

- Provides flexible space for various content types
- Supports multiple layout configurations
- Allows for responsive adjustments

**Benefits**:

- Accommodates different content types
- Supports split views when needed
- Maintains content hierarchy

### Bottom Navbar

**Layout Approach**: Flex container

- Allows for dynamic content addition
- Supports responsive spacing
- Enables easy alignment

**Purpose**:

- Quick access to frequently used tools
- System status information
- Resource monitoring

## Layout Principles

### Spacing Approach

Use relative spacing units to maintain:

- Consistent visual rhythm
- Proper element separation
- Responsive behavior
- Visual hierarchy

### Container Organization

**For Lists and Groups**:

- Use flex layouts for single-dimension alignment
- Use grid for two-dimensional layouts
- Maintain consistent spacing patterns

### Responsive Considerations

Layout should adapt by:

- Collapsing sidebar when needed
- Adjusting navigation for smaller screens
- Maintaining usability across devices

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Integration

When adding new components:

- Follow established grid/flex patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Consider responsive behavior
- Respect existing layout hierarchy

### Plugin Areas

Plugins should:

- Integrate within existing layout structure
- Follow established spacing patterns
- Support responsive adjustments
- Maintain visual consistency

### Best Practices

- Group related elements
- Maintain clear hierarchies
- Use whitespace effectively
- Keep consistent alignment

## Additional Interfaces

The following interfaces will be documented separately:

- Role-specific workspace layouts (Student, Lecturer, Lawyer)
- Individual component layouts
- Plugin interface guidelines
- Modal and overlay patterns
- Specific feature layouts
- Mobile-specific adaptations
- Tablet-specific adaptations

## Change Request Process

### Creating a Layout Change Request

```markdown
---
name: Layout Change Request
about: Suggest a layout change for this project
title: ''
labels: 'layout-change'
assignees: ''

---

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. The left sidebar is too restrictive for [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to change:
- Affected area: [e.g., Main Navigation, Sidebar, Content Area]
- Current layout behavior
- Proposed layout changes
- Impact on existing components
- Responsive considerations

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative layout solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the layout change request here:
- Mockups/wireframes of proposed changes
- Examples from similar applications
- Use case scenarios
- Accessibility considerations
```

### Implementation Considerations

When submitting a layout change request, consider:

- Impact on existing components
- Responsive behavior
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility requirements
- User experience flow
- Performance implications

### Review Process

Layout changes will be reviewed based on:

1. Alignment with design principles
2. Impact on user experience
3. Technical feasibility
4. Maintenance requirements
5. Accessibility compliance

## Notes

- This guide focuses on layout principles rather than specific measurements
- Exact spacing and sizes should be determined during implementation
- Follow established patterns for consistency
- Consider accessibility and usability in all layout decisions
