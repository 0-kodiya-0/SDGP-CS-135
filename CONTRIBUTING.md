## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FusionSpace! This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our project.

## Project Resources

- [Code Style Guide](./docs/style-guide.md)
- [API Documentation](./docs/api/README.md)
- [Database Schema](./docs/database/schema.md)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Git
- TypeScript knowledge

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FusionSpace.git
cd FusionSpace

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development Scripts

### Core Commands

```bash
# Development Mode
npm start
# Starts Electron + dev server
# Enables hot reload
# Opens dev tools

# Package Application
npm run package
# Creates executables in 'out' directory
# Bundles without installers

# Create Installers
npm run make
# Builds platform-specific distributables
# Creates installation files

# Publish Release
npm run publish
# Packages and publishes
# Requires forge.config.js setup

# Code Linting
npm run lint
# ESLint checking
# Auto-fixes available issues
```

## Development Guidelines

### Technology Stack

- Electron
- React
- Webpack
- Babel
- TypeScript

### Coding Standards

1. TypeScript Usage:
   - Enable strict mode
   - Use interfaces
   - Avoid `any` type
   - Document complex types

2. Component Guidelines:
   - Functional components
   - React hooks
   - Error handling
   - Unit testing
   - Prop validation

3. Testing Requirements:
   - Unit tests
   - 80% code coverage
   - Jest + React Testing Library

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy Options

#### 1. Direct Branching (For Core Team Members)

Best for core team members with direct repository access.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/0-kodiya-0/SDGP-CS-135.git
cd SDGP-CS-135

# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push changes
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

**When to use:**

- You're a core team member
- You have direct write access
- Working on immediate, time-sensitive features
- Collaborating closely with the team

#### 2. Fork and Branch

```bash
# 1. Fork repository (use GitHub UI)

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SDGP-CS-135.git
cd SDGP-CS-135

# 3. Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/0-kodiya-0/SDGP-CS-135.git

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]

# 5. Keep fork updated
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main

# 6. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/[feature-name]
```

**When to use:**

- Working on large, independent features
- When you need isolated development

### Branch Naming Conventions

```bash
# Features
feature/user-authentication
feature/dark-mode

# Bug fixes
fix/login-error
fix/performance-issue

# Documentation
docs/api-guide
docs/setup-instructions

# Refactoring
refactor/database-queries
refactor/component-structure
```

### Development Cycle Best Practices

1. **Before Starting**

```bash
# For direct branching
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# For forked repository
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

2. **During Development**

```bash
# Create branch with meaningful name
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

# Make small, focused commits
git commit -m "feat: add specific functionality"
```

3. ðŸ”´ **Before Submitting** ðŸ”´  <span style="color:red">  Danger zone, be carful  </span>

```bash
# Update with latest changes 
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Test your changes
npm run test
npm run lint
```

## Code Review Process

### Review Requirements

1. Maintainer approval required
2. All comments resolved
3. CI checks passing
4. Documentation updated

### Review Guidelines

- Check code quality
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure documentation
- Validate performance
- Review security implications

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Template

```
# Title: Summary, imperative, start upper case, don't end with a period
# No more than 50 chars. #### 50 chars is here:  #

# Remember blank line between title and body.
